## Usage/Examples
#### [Fill] Get a recommendation on what agent should fill
* A map must first be selected.

## Add/Import Compositions

#### The user can ADD MORE compositions or IMPORT other users compositions files
The path for the composition file is *"-appFolder-/comps/-map-.csv"* and can be edited from note pad.

#### To IMPORT
Simply replace the existing ".csv" file with the desired one.

#### To ADD MORE
Open the ".csv" file and add a row below the head with the desired composition and dont forget to save the file. (The app needs to be restarted after a file change to reload compositions)
* ***Note*** There should NOT be an empty line.
* ***Note*** Agents must be listed with commas and should be five, no more, no less, without exception. *E.g. Agent1,Agent2,Agent3,Agent4,Agent5*
* ***Note*** Every agent starts with a single capital letter followed by lower cases (with KAY/O being an exception). *E.g. Killjoy*
* ***Note*** Avoid repeating compositions in a single map, as it will repeat agents on the output. *To clarify: You can have the same composition for different maps.*

####
If you're planning on making your your own composition file, I recommend keeping it in alphabetical order so it's easier to spot repeated compositions.
